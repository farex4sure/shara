### The Problem

The improper sorting of waste from homes has a significant impact on the environment, communities, and the overall waste management system. Here's a statement highlighting the consequences of improper waste sorting:

"The improper sorting of waste from homes has far-reaching consequences for our environment and communities. When waste is not sorted correctly, it often ends up in landfills, where it contributes to the release of harmful greenhouse gases, soil and water pollution, and the depletion of natural resources. This not only poses a threat to the ecosystem but also affects the quality of life for nearby communities, leading to health hazards and reduced air and water quality.

Improper waste sorting also strains the waste management system, increasing operational costs and inefficiencies. Waste collectors face challenges in segregating mixed waste, which hampers recycling efforts and prolongs the time and resources required for waste processing. Ultimately, this leads to missed opportunities for resource recovery, increased landfill usage, and a negative impact on sustainability goals.

Additionally, improper waste sorting limits the potential for creating a circular economy, where materials can be recycled, reused, or repurposed. Valuable resources that could be reclaimed and turned into new products are lost, perpetuating a linear "take-make-dispose" model that is detrimental to our planet's finite resources.

Addressing the issue of improper waste sorting is crucial to mitigate environmental pollution, conserve resources, and foster sustainable communities. Shara's waste management platform empowers individuals and households to properly sort their waste, promoting recycling and reducing the negative impacts associated with improper waste disposal. Together, we can make a positive difference by adopting responsible waste management practices and creating a cleaner, greener future for all."


### SOLUTION

Additionally, Shara focuses on enhancing proper waste sorting practices from homes all the way to recycling companies and dumpsites. We understand that the journey of waste management does not end with waste collection from households. It is equally important to ensure that the sorted waste reaches the appropriate recycling facilities or dumpsites for proper processing and disposal.

Shara's platform facilitates the seamless flow of waste from homes to waste collectors and ultimately to the designated recycling companies or dumpsites. By streamlining this process, we eliminate bottlenecks and ensure that the sorted waste reaches its intended destination efficiently.

Through the Shara app, waste collectors can receive real-time notifications about scheduled pickups, ensuring timely collection and minimizing the chances of missed or delayed collections. This enhances the overall efficiency of the waste management process, reducing the environmental impact and promoting sustainability.

Furthermore, Shara establishes partnerships with recycling companies and dumpsites to ensure that the waste collected is directed to the appropriate facilities for recycling or safe disposal. By actively connecting homes to these crucial waste management stakeholders, we ensure that the waste sorting efforts of individuals and households have a meaningful and impactful outcome.

By enhancing waste sorting practices from homes down to recycling companies and dumpsites, Shara contributes to the larger goal of achieving a circular economy, where waste is effectively managed, resources are conserved, and environmental sustainability is prioritized.
